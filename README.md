# Blacksnow-Internet-Speed-Test
A simple React project to do internet speed test and a python script to run the speed test and return the results.

Running the Script
To run this script, ensure you have the speedtest-cli library installed. You can install it using pip:


- pip install speedtest-cli

Save the script to a file (e.g., speedtest_gui.py) and run it:

- python speedtest_gui.py

This will open a GUI window where you can start the speed test by clicking the "Start Speed Test" button. The download and upload speeds will be displayed once the test is complete.

For React project for the details find the README.MD in the blacksnow-test folder.
